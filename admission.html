                Good academic performance is a necessary prerequisite but not a sufficient condition to join the <b>IUB ARROWS </b>program. The admission process looks at other factors apart from academic records to identify the ARROWS. It is an arduous blind process executed by a committee of experts being cognizant of each student’s gender, socio-economic backgrounds, whether they are from an urban or rural setting, their storylines, significant life events, involvement in co-curricular and extracurricular activities, and much more. The selected students spend their formative years at IUB, being specifically trained and polished into becoming brand ambassadors of their institution, as well as their country. 

After their time at IUB, these leaders are placed into relevant industries, fulfilling one of IUB’s signature pledges – which also match Bangladesh’s Sustainable Development Goals – that no exceptional student – male or female, urban or rural – in this country will suffer hardship and loss of opportunities just because of their financial circumstances.
